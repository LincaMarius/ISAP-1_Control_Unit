# ISAP-1 Computer
This is my step-by-step process of designing the ISAP-1 Computer Control Unit block.

The ISAP-1 computer is the improved version of the SAP-1 computer made by me.

ISAP Computer stands for Improved Simple as Possible Computer.

This is the stage where we designed the Control Unit block of the ISAP-1 computer.

## About the project, brief description
The goal of this project is to create a more efficient version of the SAP (Simple As Possible) computer, but with minimal changes so that the instruction format remains the same.

This project helps build another project I made:
https://github.com/LincaMarius/ISAP-1_Logisim

where I build and test the functionality of the ISAP-1 computer using the Logisim program.

## The Main Instruction Set of the ISAP-1 computer is:

| Mnemonic | Opcode | Hex | Steps | Description                                                   |
|----------|--------|-----|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| LDA      | 0000   | 0h  |   4   | Load RAM data into Accumulator                                |
| ADD      | 0001   | 1h  |   5   | Add RAM data to Accumulator                                   |
| SUB      | 0010   | 2h  |   5   | Substract RAM data from accumulator                           |
| LIL      | 0011   | 3h  |   3   | Load immediate value into the lower nibble of the Accumulator |
| LIH      | 0100   | 4h  |   3   | Load immediate value into the upper nibble of the Accumulator |
| STA      | 0101   | 5h  |   4   | Store Accumulator data into RAM                               |
| CMP      | 0110   | 6h  |   5   | Compare RAM data with Accumulator                             |
| JZ       | 1001   | 9h  |   3   | Jump if Zero flag is set                                      |
| JC       | 1010   | Ah  |   3   | Jump if Carry flag is set                                     |
| JS       | 1011   | Bh  |   3   | Jump if Sign flag is set                                      |
| JMP      | 1100   | Ch  |   3   | Unconditional jump to address n                               |
| IN       | 1101   | Dh  |   4   | Input data from Port p into the Accumulator                   |
| OUT      | 1110   | Eh  |   4   | Load Accumulator data into Output Register                    |
| -        | 1111   | Fh  |   -   | Prefix for extended instruction set                           |

In total, 13 out of 15 possible instructions are implemented.

## The Extended Instruction Set of the ISAP-1 computer is:

| Mnemonic | Opcode    | Hex | Steps | Operation                                 |
|----------|-----------|-----|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| NOP      | 1111 0000 | F0h |   2   | No Operation                              |
| INC      | 1111 0001 | F1h |   4   | Increment the contents of the Accumulator |
| DEC      | 1111 0010 | F2h |   4   | Decrement the contents of the Accumulator |
| NEG      | 1111 0011 | F3h |   5   | Negate Accumulator                        |
| CPY      | 1111 1110 | FEh |   3   | Copy Accumulator data into B register     |
| HLT      | 1111 1111 | FFh |   2   | Stop processing                           |

In total, 6 extended instructions out of 16 possible are implemented.
